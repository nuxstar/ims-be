 * facilitating communication between different layers of the
 * application such as the data access layer,
 * service layer, and presentation layer.
 *
 * <p>Note: The mappers in this package should not contain any
 * business logic or data manipulation. They should primarily focus
 * on the transformation and conversion of data structures.
